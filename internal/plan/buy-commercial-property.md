**2. Buying Commercial Property**

This is an excellent long-term wealth-building goal. Turning a cost center (rent) into a profit center (rental income + property appreciation) is a savvy move.

*   **The Path to Purchase:** To secure a commercial mortgage, you'll need a track record of strong, consistent profitability and cash flow. Every dollar you make from scaling the delivery service is a step toward this goal. A bank will want to see several years of healthy business tax returns (your now single-member LLC filings and your future 1065s if you take on partners again) and a solid business plan. This goal makes the day-to-day grind of growing the delivery service much more meaningful.
