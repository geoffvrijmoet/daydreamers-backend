### Step 1 (The Most Important): Engage Your Councilwoman's Office

**Why this is your first move:** Your councilwoman is your elected advocate. Her office's job is to serve constituents and improve the community. A thriving, unique local business that enhances public parks is a clear community win. An inquiry from her office to the Parks Department carries infinitely more weight than an email from a potential vendor. You are moving from "applicant" to "constituent with representation."

**What you need to do BEFORE you email her:**

You must prepare a professional, concise "Proposal Package." Do not email her empty-handed asking for a favor. Make it easy for her and her staff to advocate for you by giving them all the ammunition they need. This package should be a single PDF document containing:

1.  **A One-Page Executive Summary:**
    *   **Who You Are:** "Daydreamers Pet Supply LLC, a constituent-owned small business based in [Your Neighborhood]."
    *   **What You Do:** "We operate a 'Pet Wellness Specialty Cart,' providing high-quality, locally sourced treats and products for dogs, a key user group of NYC Parks."
    *   **Proven Success (Your Golden Ticket):** "We have a proven track record as a successful and beloved permitted vendor at the Irving Square Park Farmers Market, demonstrating strong community demand and responsible operation." Include a sales stat or two if you're comfortable.
    *   **The Vision:** "Our vision is to expand this successful, low-impact amenity to serve dog owners during weekday off-leash hours, starting with parks in our district like Irving Square and the Kensington Dog Run."
    *   **The Specific Ask:** "We respectfully request your office's assistance in formally petitioning the NYC Parks Department to issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) for a 'Pet Wellness Specialty Cart' concession, a new vendor category that is currently unserved."

2.  **A Mini-Deck (2-3 pages):**
    *   High-quality photos of your charming wooden cart in action.
    *   Photos of your products and happy dog "customers."
    *   A few glowing customer testimonials (ask your regulars if you can quote them).

**How to make contact:**

Send a professional email to your councilwoman's main office address. Attach your Proposal Package PDF. Request a brief meeting with her or the staffer who handles community affairs or parks issues.

### Step 2 (The Secondary Move): Re-engage the Parks Employee

**Why you do this second:** This is about intelligence gathering and relationship maintenance. You should approach this contact *after* you've initiated contact with your councilwoman.

**Your approach must be strategic and light-touch.** She already told you she can't pull strings, so don't ask her to. Your goal is to remind her that you are a serious, professional, and *now-proven* operator.

**The content of your email:**

*   **Friendly Re-introduction:** "Hi [Her Name], Hope you're well. You may remember me from a couple of years ago when we discussed a potential concession for Daydreamers Pet Supply. Your guidance was very helpful."
*   **The Positive Update (This is crucial):** This is where you show, not just tell. "I wanted to share a quick positive update. For the past year, we have been operating as a fully permitted and successful vendor at the Irving Square Park Farmers Market. The community response has been fantastic and has confirmed the strong demand for a dedicated pet wellness vendor."
*   **The Soft Ask (Intelligence Gathering):** Do not ask "Can you get me an RFP?" Instead, ask for information that positions her as an expert. "Since you have your finger on the pulse of the department, I was wondering if you had any insight on whether RFPs for specialty or mobile carts might be on the horizon for 2026? Any information on the general timeline or process would be immensely helpful as we plan for the future."

By doing this, you are not pressuring her. You are respectfully updating her on your success and asking for her expert advice, which is a much more comfortable position for a government employee to be in.

**In summary:** Start with the top-down political approach by professionally engaging your councilwoman's office. Use your proven success at the farmers market as the centerpiece of your argument. Then, use a soft-touch, professional approach to re-engage your Parks contact to gather intelligence. This two-pronged strategy gives you the best possible chance of creating your own opportunity.
