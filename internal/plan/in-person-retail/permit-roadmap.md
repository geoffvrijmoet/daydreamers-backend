### Strategic Analysis of Your Dream Park List

Your list is excellentâ€”a perfect mix of ambitious "prizes" and logical "next steps." The key is to pursue them in the right order to build momentum.

**Tier 1: The Beachhead (Your First Two Applications)**

These are the permits you go after *this year*.

1.  **Irving Square Park:** As we discussed, this is your **Golden Ticket.** Your legitimate sales history at the farmers market is your undeniable proof of concept. This is the application you must perfect and submit first. A win here is the credential you need for everything else.
2.  **Kensington Dog Run:** This is a *fantastic* second target. Why? Because it's a **formally designated dog run.** This makes your case even easier than at an "off-leash hours" area. The park's purpose is *already* centered around dogs. Your business is a direct amenity to the designated user base of that specific piece of parkland. The argument is practically made for you. The fact that it's near your new home is a massive operational bonus.

**Tier 2: The Prize (Your Next Move After a Win)**

Once you have a permit for either Irving Square or Kensington, you immediately target Fort Greene.

*   **Fort Greene Park:** This is the big prize in the near term. The fact that it's an **"off-leash hours" area** is a huge advantage. You now have a proven model.
    *   **The Pitch:** "We are an approved and successful NYC Parks vendor, currently operating a Pet Wellness Cart at the [Irving Square Park off-leash hours area / Kensington Dog Run]. We propose to replicate this successful, low-impact model to provide a needed amenity to the hundreds of dog owners who use Fort Greene's designated off-leash area each morning."
    *   You are no longer asking them to take a risk on a new idea; you are asking to expand a program that already works within their own system.

*   **Prospect Park:** This is a multi-year, multi-permit goal. It's too big to tackle at once. You would first need to do reconnaissance to identify the highest-traffic dog areas (e.g., the Long Meadow, the Dog Beach near the Picnic House). Then you would apply for permits at these specific locations one by one, using your "Nandita" strategy of building a portfolio.

**Tier 3: The Moonshot (The Long-Term Vision)**

*   **Tompkins Square Park & Central Park:** These are the most competitive and complex park systems in the city. You approach these only after you have built a successful, multi-location operation in Brooklyn. By then, "Daydreamers Pet Supply" will be a known and respected partner to the Parks Department, giving you the credibility needed to compete for a spot in Manhattan.

Your path is clear. Perfect the proposal for Irving Square based on your farmers market success. Simultaneously, draft a proposal for the Kensington Dog Run based on providing a direct amenity to a designated user group. A win at either location is the key that unlocks the door to Fort Greene.
