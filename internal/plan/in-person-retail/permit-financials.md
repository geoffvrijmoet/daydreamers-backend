The answer is that it is typically **NOT** a simple fixed monthly rent like a commercial storefront. The NYC Parks Department uses a more sophisticated model designed to protect their interests and share in the upside of your success.

The most common structure, which you will almost certainly encounter in a Request for Proposals (RFP), is a license fee based on **the greater of two figures**:

1.  A **Minimum Annual Guarantee (MAG)**.
2.  A **percentage of your gross revenue**.

Let's break down exactly what this means.

### Component #1: The Minimum Annual Guarantee (MAG)

Think of this as your **minimum possible annual rent.** It is a fixed dollar amount that you guarantee to pay the Parks Department for the year, regardless of how well or poorly your business does.

*   **Purpose:** The MAG is the city's safety net. It ensures they receive a baseline level of income from the concession, even if you have a terrible sales year. It also weeds out non-serious applicants, as you have to be confident you can at least cover this minimum payment.
*   **Example in an RFP:** The RFP might state, "The minimum acceptable bid for the Minimum Annual Guarantee is $2,000 per year."

### Component #2: The Percentage of Gross Revenue

This is the revenue-sharing component. You agree to pay the city a certain percentage of every single dollar you collect in sales.

*   **Crucial Detail:** This is based on **GROSS REVENUE**, not profit. It's calculated *before* you deduct your expenses (cost of goods, labor, insurance, etc.).
*   **Purpose:** This allows the city to become your partner. If you have a wildly successful year, their revenue from your concession increases. It aligns their interests with yours.
*   **Example in an RFP:** The RFP will ask you to propose a percentage you are willing to pay (e.g., 8%, 10%, 12%).

### How It Works in Practice: You Pay Whichever is Higher

At the end of the year, you will do a simple calculation and pay the city the larger of the two numbers. You will likely be required to make estimated payments throughout the year (e.g., quarterly).

Let's use a hypothetical example. Imagine you win a permit by bidding:
*   A **MAG** of **$5,000 per year**.
*   A **Percentage** of **10% of gross revenue**.

**Scenario A: A Good Year**
*   You have a great year and your total sales at the park are **$80,000**.
*   **Calculation 1 (Percentage):** 10% of $80,000 = **$8,000**.
*   **Calculation 2 (MAG):** **$5,000**.
*   **Result:** You compare the two. Since $8,000 is greater than $5,000, **you will pay the Parks Department $8,000 for that year.**

**Scenario B: A Tough Year**
*   The weather is bad, and sales are slower. Your total sales at the park are only **$40,000**.
*   **Calculation 1 (Percentage):** 10% of $40,000 = **$4,000**.
*   **Calculation 2 (MAG):** **$5,000**.
*   **Result:** You compare the two. Since $5,000 is greater than $4,000, **you will pay the Parks Department $5,000 for that year.**

### What This Means For Your Strategy

1.  **The Bid is a Balancing Act:** When you respond to an RFP, you will be bidding both your proposed MAG and your proposed percentage. A higher MAG is safer for the city and shows you are confident, but it increases your financial risk. A higher percentage is more lucrative for the city if you succeed. Your bid needs to be both competitive and realistic.
2.  **Financial Modeling is Essential:** Before you can even think about bidding, you **must** build a financial model. You need a realistic projection of your potential annual sales at a given location. Without this, you cannot possibly know what MAG you can afford or what percentage is sustainable.
3.  **Find Old RFPs:** Your next piece of homework should be to search the NYC Parks website for past RFPs for "Specialty Carts" or similar concessions. These documents are public. They will show you the *actual* minimum bids and terms the city has requested in the past, giving you a real-world baseline.
