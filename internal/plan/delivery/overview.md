**2. Lean Into and Scale the "Golden Goose" (Viva Raw & Deliveries)**

This is your most stable and scalable channel. It's time to treat it like the core of your business.

*   **Formalize the Ordering Process:** Instead of relying on phone calls, consider setting up a simple e-commerce page on your website (platforms like Shopify or Squarespace make this easy). This would allow customers to order and pay online, making it more professional and saving you time. It also makes you look like a more established business to new referrals from Viva Raw.
*   **Actively Market the Delivery Service:** Every customer at the park and the farmers market is a potential delivery customer.
    *   Hand out a simple business card or flyer with every purchase that says, "We deliver! Get your Viva Raw and other treats brought right to your door." Include your website/phone number.
    *   Offer an incentive: "Get 10% off your first delivery order."
*   **Establish a Delivery Zone & Schedule:** Instead of ad-hoc deliveries, create a schedule (e.g., "Brooklyn deliveries on Tuesdays, Queens on Thursdays"). This makes your delivery runs far more efficient.








**1. Scaling Delivery (The "Crawl, Walk, Run" Approach)**

Before you can set up outposts in every major city, you need to perfect the model in one: New York City. The goal is to create a "business in a box" playbook that could one day be handed to a manager in Chicago or Los Angeles.

*   **Dominate Your Backyard:** Your immediate goal should be to grow from ~10 regular Viva Raw customers to 30, then 50, then 100 within your current delivery area.
    *   **Leverage Your Digital Skills:** You have a Shopify store. Optimize it for local search ("Viva Raw delivery Brooklyn"). Run hyper-targeted ads on social media aimed at pet owners within your delivery zip codes.
    *   **Systematize Deliveries:** You're already thinking about this. Batching deliveries by neighborhood on specific days is key to efficiency. As you grow, you might even consider a routing software to plan the most efficient path.
    *   **Create a "Local" Value Proposition:** Your website and marketing should scream "local." Emphasize the benefits you mentioned: no large minimum orders, next-day delivery, no wasteful dry ice, and supporting a local NYC business. This is your core advantage over ordering from the corporate website.

**3. Legal Park Sales**

Your plan to keep pursuing the RFPs is the right one. This legitimizes your grassroots channel and removes your single biggest business risk. Continue to leverage your councilwoman's office for support and information.

You have two very powerful, intertwined paths forward: scaling the high-touch, local B2C delivery business and building a scalable, high-margin B2B software company. The success of one can fuel the other.

Given your immediate interest in scaling the delivery side, what do you see as the biggest obstacle to getting from ~10 Viva Raw customers to 50 in New York City right now? Is it marketing and finding new customers, or the logistics of handling more orders?
