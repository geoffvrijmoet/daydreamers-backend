### Part 2: Scaling Delivery & The Viva Raw Partnership Idea

Your analysis of the marketing obstacle is spot-on. Your customers aren't impulse buyers from Instagram; they are educated consumers who have already decided on raw feeding and are now looking for a better, more convenient supplier.

This brings us to your "crazy idea," which is not crazy at all—it is a brilliant strategic move.

**Partnering with Viva Raw to be their official NYC fulfillment partner is your single greatest growth opportunity.**

Let's break it down into a formal proposal.

**The Pitch to Viva Raw:**

*   **The Problem You Solve (For Them):** "You have a large and growing customer base in NYC, one of the densest markets in the country. However, shipping with dry ice is inefficient, expensive, has a higher carbon footprint, and introduces a delay for the customer. Furthermore, some potential customers are deterred by the minimum order size required for shipping."
*   **Your Solution:** "Daydreamers Pet Supply, an established and trusted local retailer, will act as your official NYC fulfillment partner. We will purchase your product wholesale in bulk, store it professionally, and fulfill orders placed on *your* website for NYC customers. We can offer these customers a premium service: **'Free Same-Day or Next-Day Delivery.'**"
*   **The Benefits for Viva Raw:**
    1.  **Enhanced Customer Experience:** They can offer an "Amazon Prime"-like service in a key market, increasing customer satisfaction and loyalty.
    2.  **Increased Sales:** They will capture customers who abandoned their carts due to shipping times or minimum orders.
    3.  **Reduced Logistical Costs:** They can send one massive pallet shipment to you instead of hundreds of individual boxes.
    4.  **Brand Enhancement:** Offering a "white glove" local delivery option makes them look more innovative and customer-focused than their competitors.

**The Challenge (Why they might hesitate):**

*   **Brand Risk:** They are putting their brand's reputation in your hands. A single late or thawed delivery from you reflects on *them*. You need to prove you are operationally excellent.
*   **Channel Conflict:** They would need to manage the relationship with their other NYC retailers. The argument here is that you would be fulfilling orders *they* generated through their website, not stealing customers from other stores.

**Your Next Step:**

Don't just think about it—**write the proposal.** Draft a professional, one-page PDF that outlines this plan.

1.  Start by highlighting your success as an existing retailer and your deep understanding of the NYC market.
2.  Frame the problem and your solution clearly.
3.  Emphasize the benefits *to them*.
4.  **The Ask:** Propose a **pilot program** for a single borough, like Brooklyn, to prove the concept with minimal risk.

This moves you from being one of many retailers to a critical strategic partner. It is the fastest, most direct path to scaling your delivery business from 10 customers to hundreds.
