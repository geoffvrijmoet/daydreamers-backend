Individual trainers are passionate professionals, but they are also classic small business owners who are highly sensitive to fixed monthly costs. A $500/month fee is out of the question; even $100/month might be a tough sell unless the value is overwhelming. The product is, at its core, a specialized CRM designed to save them time and make them look more professional.

Here is a recommended pricing strategy:

**1. Eliminate the Mandatory Setup Fee**

For the individual trainer (your core market), a setup fee is a major psychological barrier. It creates friction and hesitation. Modern SaaS for solopreneurs is all about making it incredibly easy to sign up and get started.

*   **Your Strategy:** Offer a **$0 setup fee**. Get them into the product and let its value hook them. You can, however, offer an **optional, paid "White Glove Onboarding" service** for something like $49 or $99. This would be a 1-on-1 call where you help them import their client list, set up their schedule, and customize their forms. It's a value-add, not a barrier.

**2. Implement a Tiered Monthly Subscription (Value-Based Tiers)**

This allows trainers to enter at a low price point and upgrade as their business grows and they need more features.

*   **Tier 1: The "Solo Trainer" Plan**
    *   **Price:** **$19 to $29 per month.** This is the sweet spot. It's a "no-brainer" priceâ€”less than the cost of one client no-show, less than a few fancy coffees.
    *   **Features:** The essentials. Everything a single trainer needs to run their business:
        *   Client Management (CRM)
        *   Scheduling & Calendar Sync for one trainer
        *   Waivers & Intake Forms
        *   Session Report Cards
        *   Online Booking Page

*   **Tier 2: The "Pro Trainer" Plan**
    *   **Price:** **$39 to $59 per month.** This is for the established trainer who wants to automate and grow.
    *   **Features:** Everything in "Solo Trainer," plus features that directly save money or increase revenue:
        *   **Automated SMS/Email Reminders:** The single biggest ROI feature. It drastically reduces no-shows.
        *   **Online Payment Integration (Stripe/Square):** Allow clients to pay when they book.
        *   **Package & Bundle Sales:** Sell a 5-pack of sessions at a discount.
        *   **Group Class Management:** Schedule and manage multi-dog classes.

**Why this works:** It aligns your revenue with your customer's success. A new trainer can easily afford the basic plan. As their business grows and they need to manage group classes or reduce no-shows, the upgrade to the "Pro" plan pays for itself.
