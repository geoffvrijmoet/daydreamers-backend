### The Agency Question

Should you create a separate product for dog training agency owners? **Absolutely, yes.**

This is a completely different market segment with different needs and a different ability to pay. Trying to serve them with the same product as an individual trainer will fail both audiences.

**This is your "Enterprise" plan.** It's a different sale, a different feature set, and a different price point.

**The Product: "TrainerPro Teams" (or "Agency Suite")**

This product is not just a CRM; it's a **Practice Management Platform**. The agency owner is not just thinking about their own schedule; they're managing a team, payroll, and the overall business P&L.

**Key Features for the Agency Product:**

*   **Centralized Admin Dashboard:** The owner can see everything at a glance.
*   **Multi-Trainer Scheduling:** View all trainer calendars, assign clients based on availability or specialty.
*   **Team Permissions:** Control what individual trainers can see and do.
*   **Consolidated Billing & Reporting:** Track revenue per trainer, run payroll reports.
*   **Client Assignment Workflow:** When a new lead comes in, the owner can assign it to a specific trainer.

**How to Price for Agencies:**

Now, your experience with the doula agency model becomes directly relevant.

*   **Setup Fee:** **Yes. This is where it makes sense.** An agency requires significant onboarding. You are migrating their data, setting up multiple user accounts, and providing training to the owner and their staff. A setup fee in the **$500 - $2,500 range** is completely justifiable, depending on the agency's size. This is a B2B sale, and such fees are standard for business software implementation.

*   **Monthly Subscription:** The pricing model should reflect the number of users.
    *   **Model:** **Base Fee + Per-User Fee.**
    *   **Example:** **$79/month (base platform fee) + $19/month for each additional trainer.**
    *   This scales beautifully. A small agency with an owner and two trainers would pay `$79 + (2 * $19) = $117/month`. A large agency with 10 trainers would pay `$79 + (9 * $19) = $250/month`.
